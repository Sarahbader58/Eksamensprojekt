            <p class="p1">Hey there! I'm Sarah Bader, a 23-year-old living and studying in the charming city of Odense at UCL. By day, you'll find me whipping up delicious drinks and spreading good vibes at Joe & the Juice, but my real passion lies in exploring my creative side as a multimedia designer.
                When I'm not immersed in pixels and design elements, you can catch me hitting the pavement, pounding out miles on a run, or soaking up the sun with my nearest and dearest. There's nothing quite like the feeling of the sun on your skin and the wind in your hair as you share laughs and good times with friends and family.</p>
            <p class="p2"> On this website, I invite you to join me on my journeyâ€”a journey filled with creativity, exploration, and a zest for life. Let's dive into the world of multimedia design together, where every project is a new adventure waiting to unfold.
                So grab your favorite beverage, kick back, and let's embark on this creative journey together. Welcome to my corner of the internet!</p>
